## Pages

### `/` — Landing Page
The main landing page featuring:
- **Dark mode toggle** — SVG-based day/night toggle with smooth fade transition
- **CTA Slider** — Optimized `requestAnimationFrame` animation (zero React re-renders). Car icon travels across a gradient bar revealing Design → Develop → Test labels. Fully draggable/touch-enabled.
- **Gallery** — Hover-expand image gallery with progressive width decay. Active image expands to full width, right neighbours decay at 50% → 30% → collapsed. On tablet/mobile it becomes a full-screen swiper with touch gestures, dot indicators, and prev/next arrows.
- **Services Section** — Animated service cards
- **Stylists Section** — Team member profiles
- **Join Our Team / Contacts** — Footer sections

### `/task2` — Stripe Diagram
An interactive payment systems architecture diagram featuring:
- **System pills row** — ERP, CRM, Subscriptions, Legacy billing, Booking system
- **Animated branch lines** — Dashed SVG paths with SMIL particle animation converging into Stripe
- **SDK + Event Destinations** — Positioned directly on the branch line endpoints via `foreignObject`
- **Main chain** — App logos (flip cards) → App Marketplace → Stripe → Data Pipeline → External icon
- **Orchestration tree** — Stripe → Orchestration → 4 PSP nodes with fan-out branch lines
- **Entrance animations** — Staggered fade-up on load

## What Was Built

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| Modular layout | Shared `Header` + `Footer` via `layout.tsx` — all pages inherit automatically |
| TypeScript components | All components fully typed with exported interfaces |
| CSS-only animations | No animation libraries — pure keyframes + SMIL |
| Optimized CTA slider | Direct DOM mutation via `useRef` — 60fps, zero re-renders |
| Responsive gallery | Flex-grow ratio system — fully responsive at all breakpoints |
| Mobile swiper | Touch swipe, dot indicators, prev/next for tablet and below |
| Dark mode | SVG toggle, persisted via React state, applied via `.dark` class |
| Flip cards | CSS 3D `perspective` + `rotateY` with staggered timing |
| Dot grid background | Configurable count + columns, absolute-positioned decorative layer |

## Notes

- All images go in `public/assets/` — filenames must match exactly as listed in the structure above
- SVG toggle icons go in `public/assets/svg/`
- The project uses the `@/` path alias for `src/` imports
- Dark mode is toggled via a `.dark` class on the `<html>` element
